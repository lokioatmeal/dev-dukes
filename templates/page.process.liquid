    <h2>No. 1</h2>
    <h3>Fresher Cuts of Meat</h3>
    <p>Our steak and brisket strips are carefully crafted with 100% grass-fed beef. We use fresh, never frozen pork and chicken that is delivered to our kitchen right at 32 degrees whenever possible. It’s not easy (it’s why most other brands don’t do it), but we wouldn’t do it any other way.</p>

    <h2>No. 2</h2>
    <h3>Fresh, Real or Whole Ingredients<br /> (Not Just Dried Spices)</h3>
    <p>Dried spices are great, but nothing can recreate the flavor of real chile oils, ripe vegetables, juicy fruits, and diced herbs when it comes to flavoring meats. It’s the not-so-secret way we get our fresh flavor mojo.</p>

    <h2>No. 3</h2>
    <h3>Creative, Fresh Smoke Pairings</h3>
    <p>We bring a different level of creativity to how we smoke our meats. Red wine-soaked barrel wood, avocado wood chips, single barrel bourbon cask planks… Hell yeah. Different, unique hardwood smokes add more complex and nuanced flavors to our meats.</p>

    <h2>No. 4</h2>
    <h3>Freshly Crafted in Small Batches</h3>
    <p>All of our meats are made in small batch case quantities of 250 cases or less. Next time you are enjoying a bag of Duke’s, flip over the bag. We stamp the specific batch case quantity right there on the back for you to see.</p>
